# 📐 String Calculator

This project implements a **String Calculator** following **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles, ensuring 100% test coverage. The solution adheres to the **AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)**, ensuring clean and maintainable test cases.

## 🚀 Features

- Supports basic operations: **Addition (+)**, **Subtraction (-)**, **Multiplication (*)**, and **Division (/)**.
- Handles:
  - Negative numbers
  - Decimal numbers
  - Multiple numbers in a single calculation
  - Error handling for division by zero and invalid operators
- Ignores numbers larger than **1000**.
- Follows the correct **order of operations** (PEMDAS).

## 🧪 Test Cases

All test cases are implemented to guarantee the correctness of the calculator. Each commit corresponds to a new feature or test case, ensuring step-by-step development.
